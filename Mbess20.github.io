            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Michelle Bess. I am a 27-year-old female, medically retired from the active duty Air Force where I served as Security Forces for 5 years and 7 months. I was deployed to Qatar and Kandahar and sustained a back injury during a gunner exercise. Initially hesitant to seek medical attention due to the culture in Security Forces, especially as a female, I eventually got my back checked and was found to have 3 possibly 4 fractures in my lower back.</p>
            <p>This blog is a life tool guide for women, men, teens, and anyone trying to find themselves. I will be sharing my experiences, including overcoming alcohol abuse and managing anxiety and ADHD. My goal is to help others find joy and fulfillment in their lives.</p>
